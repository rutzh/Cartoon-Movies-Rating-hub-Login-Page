This project is a login page for a Cartoon Movie Rating Hub. It provides users with a simple and intuitive interface to log in or create a new account if they don't have one already. The login page is built using HTML and CSS, and JavaScript will be implemented soon to add interactivity and enhance the user experience.

## Challenges I faced 

During the development of this project, I encountered a few challenges. One particular hurdle was creating the registration form to be shown only when the user clicks the appropriate link. Initially, I struggled to find a solution to this requirement. However, after some experimentation, I managed to implementthis feature.

## Features I wish to implement over-time

- User authentication 
- Landing page that appears after users is fully authenticated
- Rating feature .
